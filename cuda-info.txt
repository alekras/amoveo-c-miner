 -- totalGlobalMem = -1129250816 is the total amount of global memory available on the device in bytes.
 -- totalConstMem = 65536 is the total amount of constant memory available on the device in bytes.
 -- multiProcessor Count = 9
 -- maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor = 2048 is the number of maximum resident threads per multiprocessor.
 -- warpSize = 32 is the warp size in threads.
 -- sharedMemPerMultiprocessor = 98304 is the maximum amount of shared memory available to a multiprocessor in bytes;
       this amount is shared by all thread blocks simultaneously resident on a multiprocessor.
 -- regsPerMultiprocessor = 65536 is the maximum number of 32-bit registers available to a multiprocessor;
       this number is shared by all thread blocks simultaneously resident on a multiprocessor
 -- clockRate = 1835000 is the clock frequency in kilohertz.
 -- memoryClockRate = 4004000 is the peak memory clock frequency in kilohertz.
 -- major = 6, minor = 1 are the major and minor revision numbers defining the device's compute capability.
 -- computeMode = 0 is the compute mode that the device is currently in.
 -- maxThreadsPerBlock = 1024 is maximum number of threads per block.
 -- sharedMemPerBlock = 49152 is the maximum amount of shared memory available to a thread block in bytes.
 -- regsPerBlock = 65536 is the maximum number of 32-bit registers available to a thread block.
 -- maxThreadsDim[3] = [1024,1024,64] contains the maximum size of each dimension of a block.
 -- maxGridSize[3] = [2147483647,65535,65535] contains the maximum size of each dimension of a grid.
 -- canMapHostMemory = 1 is 1 if the device can map host memory into the CUDA address space for use with cudaHostAlloc()/cudaHostGetDevicePointer(), or 0 if not.
 -- asyncEngineCount = 2 is 1 when the device can concurrently copy memory between host and device while executing a kernel.
       It is 2 when the device can concurrently copy memory between host and device in both directions and execute a kernel at the same time.
       It is 0 if neither of these is supported.
 -- unifiedAddressing = 1 is 1 if the device shares a unified address space with the host and 0 otherwise.
